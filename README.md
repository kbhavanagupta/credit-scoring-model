# credit-scoring-model
The Credit Scoring Model repository aims to build a predictive model for a bank, enabling data-driven lending decisions. This model utilizes the Logistic Regression classifier and decile methodology to formulate an effective lending strategy.



**Problem Statement**



Banks and financial institutions often face challenges in assessing the creditworthiness of loan applicants. Traditional methods of credit scoring rely on historical data and statistical analysis to determine a borrower's credit score. However, these methods may not always be effective in predicting the likelihood of loan repayment accurately.




**Solution Overview**



The Credit Scoring Model project offers a solution by leveraging machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of loan repayment based on historical customer data. The project employs the Logistic Regression classifier, a popular algorithm for binary classification tasks, to build the predictive model. Additionally, it utilizes decile methodology to formulate business rules for accepting or rejecting new loan applications, thereby optimizing business profitability and market penetration.




**Key Features**



Utilizes Logistic Regression classifier for predictive modeling.
Implements decile methodology to formulate lending strategy.
Provides data-driven insights for making informed lending decisions.
Offers a comprehensive toolkit with training datasets and Python source code for hands-on learning and reuse.



**Usage**



Clone the repository to your local machine.
Access the provided dataset and Python source code files.
Use Google Colab or a similar platform for model building and analysis.
Follow the step-by-step instructions in the provided code cells to understand the project workflow.
Customize the model parameters and thresholds based on your business requirements.
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy score and confusion matrix.
Utilize the output files to derive insights and make data-driven lending decisions.



**Getting Started**


To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

https://github.com/kbhavanagupta/credit-scoring-model/edit/main/README.md

Navigate to the project directory:

cd  Credit-Scoring-Model

Open the project in Google Colab or any Python environment with the required dependencies installed.


Follow the instructions in the code cells to build and analyze the model.


Refer to the README file and documentation for detailed information on project usage and implementation.



**Data Sources**



The datasets used for training the Logistic Regression classifier are sourced from folder dataset/a_Dataset_CreditScoring.xlsx.





**Methodology**



The decile methodology employed in formulating the lending strategy involves segmenting the customer base into ten equal groups based on their credit scores. This approach allows the bank to prioritize lending decisions and allocate resources effectively.
